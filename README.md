# Snakemake executor plugin: slurm-gustave-roussy

This executor is based on the work done for the 
[snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm/tree/main)
plugin. It aims to replace default behaviours welcomed in
a generic plugin with very specific ones, designed and tuned
for [Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en) computing cluster.

For documentation, see the 
[Snakemake plugin catalog](https://snakemake.github.io/snakemake-plugin-catalog/plugins/executor/slurm-gustave-roussy.html).
