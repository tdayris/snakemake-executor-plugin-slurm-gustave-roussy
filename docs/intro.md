This executor is based on the work done for the 
[snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm](https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm/tree/main)
plugin. It aims to replace default behaviours welcomed in
a generic plugin with very specific ones, designed and tuned
for [Gustave Roussy](https://www.gustaveroussy.fr/en) computing cluster.
